# Modify Email-Addresses

In some cases you might want to modify a list of email-addresses by systematically inserting a certain literal. For example, in Lernsax there is special notation for email addresses which allows to reach both parents if they are registered.

If for example the child has the email-address matze.mueller@lernsax.de then the parents might be reachable at matze.mueller.e1@lernsax.de and matze.mueller.e2@lernsax.de. Having a list of normal child email-addresses enables you to generate a list of parent email addresses from it, with the literal e1 and e2 at the right place.

For usage, just adapt the filename path.
